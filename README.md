## :question: About Me
I'm a Full Stack Software Engineer who loves to both break and build the web. Ever since I started programming I've had a particular interest in web scraping, automation, bots and security for which I've grown an expertise. The other side of me loves to develop web applications, always contemplating the most optimal solution.

Besides my main occupation, I'm interested in other fields such as (but not limited to) cross-platform mobile app development, reverse engineering, GNU/Linux, Containers, DevOps and cloud.

If you'd like to **hire me** or if you're **looking for a partner** for your next project, check out [my socials](#Socials) and shoot me a DM.

I'm also active on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/sleeyax).
