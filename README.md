# :wave: Hello World
Welcome to the GitHub profile of a Software Engineer with a dragon profile picture!

## :question: About Me
I'm a part time Software Engineer with experience in a wide range of fields. I don't tend to stick to one programming language or stack in particular; I love to think about architecture, quality of code, project requirements, performance etc. in order to make an informed decision on which tech stack suites a project best. 

I'm always open to new opportunities, shoot me a DM on [twitter](https://twitter.com/sleeyax) or [send me an email](mailto:yourd3veloper@gmail.com) with your project offer :)
