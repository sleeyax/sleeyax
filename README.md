## :question: About Me
I'm a Full Stack Software Engineer who loves to both break and build the web. Ever since I started programming I've had a particular interest in web scraping, automation, bots and security for which I've grown an expertise. Some may recognize me from my contributions in a time where sneaker bots were still cool (see projects below). The other side of me loves to develop web applications from scratch with whatever tech stack suits a project best.

Besides my main occupation, I also have an interest in other fields such as but not limited to cross-platform mobile app development, reverse engineering, GNU/Linux, Containers, DevOps and cloud.

If you'd like to **hire me** or if you're **looking for a partner** for your next project, check out [my socials](#Socials) and shoot me a DM.
