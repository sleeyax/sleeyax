# :wave: Hello World
Nice to see you on my GitHub profile.

## :question: About Me
I'm a part time freelancer with experience in a wide range of fields. I don't tend to stick to one programming language or stack in particular; I love to think about architecture, quality of code, project requirements, performance etc. in order to make an informed decision on which tech stack suites a project best. 

I'm always open to short term project offers, shoot me a DM on twitter or send me an email :)
